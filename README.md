# Movie_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
Here we will be analysing if the given movie review is a positive review or a negative review, based on its context. We having a .csv file with around 2000 movie reviews. We will analyse them and will perform sentiment analysis on them.

* Analysing file and creating DTM
* Cleaning and preprocessing
* Creating model
* Plotting and analysing further
# Conclusion:
Accuracy seems okay, if we compare the actual and predicted sentiment for the reviews from test data. Although we can still get better accuracy by preprocessing the data futher by adding more stop words and modifying our document term matrix further. The more we will be able to preprocess our document term matrix, the more accuracy we will be able to achieve using Naive Bayes Model.
